## Automatic Assessment of Quadratic Equation Solutions Using MathBERT and RoBERTa Embeddings

This project aims to create a machine learning classification system that classifies solutions to quadratic equations into three different groups: "Incorrect," "Partially Correct," and "Correct." MathBERT and RoBERTa embeddings are utilized in this system. A multi-class classification technique is used by the system, with an emphasis on feature engineering, data preparation, and model selection. 

To improve model performance, methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), and ensemble meta models with Boosting, Voting, and Stacking are used. The efficacy of many classification models in correctly classifying quadratic solutions is examined in this work. To evaluate the performance of the model, evaluation measures including F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall are used. 

The results show that MathBERT embeddings outperform RoBERTa embeddings. Ensemble models, especially those that include SVM and MLP classifiers, achieve the best performance, with the stacking approach yielding an accuracy of approximately 65%. This model accurately classifies solutions into the correct categories, demonstrating the potential for practical applications in mathematics education.
